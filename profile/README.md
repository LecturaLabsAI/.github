Lectūra Labs is a young AI+Education lab focused on research and development of AI-native tools and models that empower individual learners to master needed self-taught skills. We draw inspiration from Richard Feynman’s core belief - that anyone, with curiosity, clear thinking and persistence, can master even the most complex ideas. As he once beautifully said, "What I cannot create, I do not understand" He taught that true understanding stems from being able to recreate or explain things so simply you could teach them yourself. At Lectūra Labs, we are building AI educational tools and models that are rooted in that same philosophy - tools that empower anyone, anywhere, to teach themselves anything.
